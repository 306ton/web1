    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <hr>
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document <br>
    written in a markup language such as HTML.<br>
    CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
    This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control <br>
    in the specification of presentation characteristics, <br>
    enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS <br>
    in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as <br>
    enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages <br>
    that share the file and its formatting.
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page <br>
    in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, <br>
    by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. <br>
    CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.<br>
    The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine <br>
    which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. <br>
    This cascading priority scheme is predictable.<br>
    The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).<br>
    Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).<br>
    The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.<br>
    In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.<br>
