    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <hr>
    The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language<br> 
    for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br> 
    It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) <br> 
    and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br> 
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage <br> 
    and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <br> 
    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues <br> 
    for the appearance of the document.<br> 
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. <br> 
    With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms <br> 
    may be embedded into the rendered page.<br> 
    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text <br> 
    such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <br> 
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. <br> 
    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, <br> 
    which affects the behavior and content of web pages. <br> 
    Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. <br> 
    The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML <br> 
    and current maintainer of the CSS standards, <br> 
    has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997<br>
